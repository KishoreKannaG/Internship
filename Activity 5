'''
Step 1: create a file name p1.py
Step 2: declare & initialize the pin number (ex: pin=1234)
Step 3: Use while loop to iterate following statement thrice

(ii) Compare a input pin with existing pin number
(iii) If both pin numbers are matched, display pin number is matched at count
time & exit from loop.
(iv) If all 3 attempts fails, display message “your pin is blocked.”

file1 = open("p1.py", "r")
pin_value = file1.read()
print(pin_value)
for i in range(3):
  pin=input()
  if(str(pin)==pin_value):
    print("Entered values is wrong!")
    print("{} try left ".format(3-i))
  else:
    print("Entered pin is correct")
file1.close()
